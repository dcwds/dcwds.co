            <p>
              I started building websites on a dial-up connection when I was 13
              years old.
            </p>

            <p>
              I landed my first job in 2009 as a web designer for a small agency
              in California which had later become a web-based productivity SaaS
              startup, Rule.fm, where I lead design.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Rule, I was solely responsible for branding, marketing sites,
              and the product UI for web and mobile. We were acquired in 2013 by
              the productivity SaaS startup, Glip.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              A lot of my growth as a front-end developer happened at Glip,
              where I was expected to implement my design work into our product.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the subsequent years after Glip was acquired in late 2015, I
              had the opportunity to further develop my front-end skills through
              small, personal projects.
